"I own a 2002 Ford Explorer. It's our daily driver. Everything works except the hubs. This truck has never been wrecked and we find ourselves about every 15000 to 20000 miles having to replace the wheel bearings and hub assemblies. Last night on the way home the driver side front hub started squealing and came apart and we had to have it towed. Again, I have owned this truck for 3 years. I have had to replace the bearings and hubs brakes 11 times and now I'm going to have to do it again. Wow, these parts are really expensive to have no better quality than that. Every time we get it fixed it costs around $1400. It's a nice truck and everything else works great. No issues. I transport my family members in this vehicle and I'm getting tired of fearing for their lives and my own when the wheel hubs break and leave us stranded. It's obviously time for a different vehicle. And I just thought about how many other people drive one of those trucks and how dangerous that could have been out on the interstate. It's a good thing we were driving 30 mph on a country rd. If we had been in town when it broke again we I thought that the last time this happened too. There definitely is a problem when the guy at the dealership says that's a very common problem but unfortunately all he can do is fix it or sell me something else. And that that's the issue that those trucks have and that every day someone is dropping one of to get fixed for the exact same problem. Anyway, I think it's time to try something else. But this problem needs to be on a recall list because it's just bad business and a safety hazard and it's probably already gotten people and families killed. I'm going to fix this thing one more time and give the people that buy it this website info.

"My husband and I purchased a 2002 Ford Explorer XLT around mid July/early August 2002. In August of 2003 I noticed that my car was experiencing some clunking in the transmission. I don't know the full detail of that problem but they gave me an extra 5 year warranty on my vehicle. Last year my family and I took a trip to Florida and my car would get this loud roaring sound at 45 miles per hour. When we returned from my trip I called to complain about it. They asked me to bring it to them but they said that it was my tires. My husband replaced the tires hoping that this would resolved the problem. (Even before this problem because they requested us too). A week later my husband and I went to Texas and the sound got worse. Upon returning from our trip I was told that it was my axle. My family and I could have been killed because of their mistake. I've had my front and rear wheel bearings, axle, axle boot, hubs, bearings, and emergency brake (which they say was split) replaced. I still hear a problem with my transmission but they keep telling me that my car is safe to ride in. I do not feel safe in this vehicle. I've gone to the attorney general filed a complaint for arbitration. My (prepaid) attorney has even sent them two letters advising them to take this situation seriously. They never replied back to me or my attorney. I'm Ford plan and I really thought that I would be treated with a little more respect. I want them to be responsible and see that they sold me a ""lemon"". I really need some help.

This was an unsafe situation as I expected the vehicle to function properly. I took the car to the dealer and was told the transmission had to be totally rebuilt for $2400 since I was 4000 mi out of warranty even though <3 years. I asked the service manager if Ford would cover it. The zone person advised no. I phoned customer assistance and was told there were dealer/field discretionary funds to pay for repairs outside of warranty but only for ""loyal"" customers. I was told that I should have purchased the vehicle new and had my maintenance done at the dealer. I asked what maintenance should been done on the transmission. I was told that there was none. I spoke with a gentleman in the quality department at a local transmission plant who said this was a common failure but that Ford wouldn't offer any help because ""money is tight"". He said that the bands in my transmission had been superseded twice due to this problem and a tech bulletin existed explaining this to dealerships. I read many other complaints on this website! I fail to understand why Ford honors a secret warranty for ""loyal"" customers yet offers no recourse for customers who were put in the same unsafe situation just because they bought the vehicle used. I had the repair done at an independent repair facility. Ford advises they will not take any financial responsibility because the repair was done at an independent. I am one of many consumers who must drive in a defective and dangerous vehicle due to this transmission problem.
